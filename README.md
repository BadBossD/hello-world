My First Repo

Well my name is David. My first computer was a Texas Instrument that my parents bought me when I was 5... and all I did was play games on it. Eventually my mom felt it was necessary for me to have a real computer, so she bought me a custom built x86 with a 32 MB hard drive.

It's been downhill ever since.
